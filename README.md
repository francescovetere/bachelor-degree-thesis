This is my Bachelor's Degree thesis in Computer Science, entitled "Automatic generation and execution of test cases for the Java library JSetL".

In this thesis I wrote a software, in C++, that automates the unit-testing process for [JSetL](http://www.clpset.unipr.it/jsetl/), a Java library developed at the University of Parma that allows the user to use a declarative style of programming inside the classic imperative paradigm of Java.
 
Please see the full [thesis](https://github.com/francescovetere/bachelor-degree-thesis/blob/master/thesis/thesis.pdf) in order to have a better understanding of how the software works.
